This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Preface

This app hasn't optimised with compressed image and hasn't been responsive with the mobile size (minimum width: 600px).
It will be optimised in near future. [Ian's Profile](https://ian-wei-my-profile.herokuapp.com/)
