            Iâ€™m so glad that I can be a software engineer since my major was in electrical engineering, not in
            information technology.

            In the period of university, I found that programming is amazing and attractive. It gave me a sense of
            achievement once I completed a certain function with a piece of code because debugging is annoying to every
            programmer. For example, killing a bug is like defeating an enemy in a game. Fixing a function, like
            defeating a boss in the final mission!
